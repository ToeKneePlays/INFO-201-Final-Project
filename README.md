# Executive Summary

Our dataset is the NYC school system where we will focus on the two subjects of “Average SAT Scores for NYC Public Schools” and “NYC Public School Attendance”. The goal is to analyze and research the dataset to see a correlation between SAT scores and subject matters such as poverty, economic need, attendance, characteristics of each school in NYC, etc. A new figure we computed in our final dataset was the "total_avg_SAT" and "score_category". The "total_avg_SAT" was computed by adding both the Average Math SAT Score and the Average Reading SAT Score together. The "score_category" was computed whether the total_avg_SAT score was above or below the score of 1050 threshold.

The primary target audience for our analysis is educators, policymakers, educational researchers, and parents of children with a focus on the New York City school system.

We are assuming that our audience is likely to be knowledgeable about the influential factors such as attendance and socioeconomic conditions when it comes to the school’s SAT ratings and attendance. Our focus however is to be presenting insights resulted from the correlation analysis between SAT scores and attendance, economic need, and poverty levels in NYC public schools. By tailoring our explanations to their existing knowledge base, we aim to make our findings more accessible and actionable for our target audience.
